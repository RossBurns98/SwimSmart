# SwimSmart Tracker

SwimSmart Tracker is a training log and performance insight tool built for swimmers and coaches.
The goal of this project is to provide a structured way to record swim sessions, track performance data, and analyze progress over time.

---

## Project Vision

- Provide swimmers with an easy way to log sets, reps, times, and Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).
- Give coaches access to swimmer logs, helping them monitor training trends and workload.
- Enable CSV exports and simple dashboards for progress tracking.
- Build a clean, intuitive interface suitable for both athletes and coaches.

---

## Planned Features

- **Session Logging** – Record sets, distances, times, and RPE.
- **Custom Set Structures** – Support flexible formats (e.g., `20 × 100m freestyle`).
- **Performance Tracking** – Capture rep times, session summaries, and pace trends.
- **Coach Dashboard** – Allow coaches to view athlete logs and performance insights.
- **Notes & Annotations** – Add notes at the rep or set level.
- **Templates** – Save and reuse common set structures.
- **CSV Export** – Export training data for further analysis.
- **Role-Based Access** – Distinguish between swimmer and coach accounts.

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: React with TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based system
- **Deployment**: Docker + cloud hosting (future)

## Current Status

This project is in the **early development phase**.
Implementation will follow a phased approach, starting with session logging and CSV export, then expanding to dashboards, templates, and role-based access.

---

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1** – Core logging functionality and CSV export
2. **Phase 2** – Authentication and role-based access (Swimmer vs. Coach)
3. **Phase 3** – Coach dashboard and progress summaries
4. **Phase 4** – Templates and saved set structures
5. **Phase 5** – Visual dashboards and cloud deployment
